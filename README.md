## Key points:
- Change the scope of addEventListener function from the botton section to all the actual buttons by using querySelectorAll and forEach().
- Varible buffer is created to hold the current input number. It is set as a string in order to relize the "‚Üê" button function which is delete one digit of the input number.
- The "screen" will shows "0" everytime press a new button.
- Pressing "=" means ending of the current operation. Everything should return to its initial value.
